          <h3>Adam Copeland, Founder</h3>
        </aside>

        <p>Adam Copeland formed Copeland Developments, LLC (CDLLC) in 2010. Adam began working in QSRs when he was still in high school and worked his way through college. He started at Jimmy John’s as a delivery driver and very quickly saw the opportunity for advancement and the chance to learn the business from the bottom up. He went from delivery driver, to assistant manager, general manager, multi- unit manager (area manager) and later worked as a marketing director for over 30 stores. Additionally, Adam worked side by side with Jimmy John’s largest franchise owner as a New Store Opening Specialist. Adam Copeland has opened over 20 stores from the very beginning processes, to operating the restaurant in all its capacities.</p>
        <p>After working for the largest Jimmy John’s franchisee in the entire organization for nine years, he realized with the wealth of knowledge acquired, that he could replicate the same success. In 2010, Adam chose the DC market as the location for his first stores because of its size and excellent growth potential. CDLLC’s first Jimmy John’s opened in December 2011 in Bethesda, which has already grown exponentially. As a company, Copeland Development strives to be the best and expects the same from everyone that works for the company, be they minimum wage sandwich makers or salaried managers. Jimmy John’s as a concept and culture does the same with a calculated growth and marketing strategy. CDLLC is a company that values hard work, integrity, and a sense of fulfillment for what we do.</p>
